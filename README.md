### Creating and Managing View Triggers
**Lesson: Working with Triggers and Views in SQL Server

This project focuses on creating and managing SQL Server triggers and building complex views across multiple schemas. It includes creating tables with identity columns and implementing triggers for insert, update, and delete operations to track employee history. Sample data is inserted and manipulated to test trigger behavior. Views are created using joins, system functions, grouping, filtering, and conditional logic. The project showcases essential skills for automating data tracking and generating meaningful insights from relational databases.
